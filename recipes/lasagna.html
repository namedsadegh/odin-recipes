		<h1>Description:</h1>
			<p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait.
				You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
		<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Meat/li>
				<p>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef</p>
				<li>Onion and garlic</li>
				<p>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>
				<li>Tomato products</li>
				<p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>
				<li>Sugar</li>
				<p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>
				<li>Spices and seasonings</li>
				<p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
				<li>Lasagna noodles</li>
				<p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
				<li>Cheeses</li>
				<p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
				<li>Egg</li>
				<p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
