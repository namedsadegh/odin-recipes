            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <p>It's not potato salad without potatoes. This recipe calls for medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad,
                    I'll cover that in the next section.</p>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <p> Hard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to.</p>
                <li>Celery</li>
                <p>Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.</p>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <p>You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion.</p>
                <li>Relish</li>
                <p>Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet</p>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                <p>This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl.
                    Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.</p>
                <li>Mustard</li>
                <p>Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.</p>
                <li>Seasonings</li>
                <p>This recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder.
                    You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon.</p>
            </ul>
